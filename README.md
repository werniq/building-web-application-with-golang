# building-web-application-with-golang

While completing this course, I've learned how to:
How to build a secure, production ready web application in Go

How to capture the necessary information for a secure online credit card transaction

How to call the Stripe API from a Go back end to create a paymentIntent (Stripe's object for authorizing and making a transaction)

Once we have that out of the way, we'll build a second web application in the next section of the course, consisting of a simple web site that allows users to purchase a product, or purchase a monthly subscription. Again, this will be a web application built from the ground up in Go. In this section of the course, we'll cover the following:

How to allow users to purchase a single product

How to allow users to purchase a recurring monthly subscription (a Stripe Plan)

How to handle cancellations and refunds

How to save all transaction information to a database (for refunds, reporting, etc).

How to refund a transaction

How to cancel a subscription

How to secure access to the front end (via session authentication)

How to secure access to the back end API (using stateful tokens)

How to manage users (add/edit/delete)

How to allow users to reset their passwords safely and securely

How to log a user out and cancel their account instantly, over websockets
